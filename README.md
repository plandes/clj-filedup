# Find Duplicate Files by Content

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

  [travis-link]: https://travis-ci.org/plandes/clj-filedup
  [travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/plandes/clj-filedup.svg?branch=master

This is a command line program that finds files that are duplicates in a
directory tree.  It traverses a directory recursively and finds files that are
the same by content.  It does this by computing and reporting
duplicate [md5sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum).


## Obtaining

The latest release binaries are
available [here](https://github.com/plandes/clj-filedup/releases/latest).


## Usage

This is a command line application that has the following usage (given with `-h`):
```sql
$ filedup -h
usage: filedup [options]
find duplicate files
  -l, --level <log level>      INFO  Log level to set in the Log4J2 system.
  -a, --absolute                     Print absolute path names if given
  -d, --directory <directory>  .     The directory to find duplicate files.
```

To find all the duplicates in directory `test-directory`:
```bash
$ filedup -d test-resources
test-resources/dupdir/file1 test-resources/dupdir/file3
```

To get more output:
```bash
$ filedup -l info -d test-resources
filedup: find-dups: finding duplicate files in test-resources
filedup: find-dups: processing test-resources/dupdir/file1
filedup: find-dups: processing test-resources/dupdir/file2
filedup: find-dups: processing test-resources/dupdir/file3
filedup: find-dups: processing test-resources/log4j2.xml
test-resources/dupdir/file1 test-resources/dupdir/file3
```


## Building

To build from source, do the folling:

- Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) (this is just a script)
- Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- Download the source: `git clone https://github.com/clj-nlp-feature && cd clj-nlp-feature`
- Download the make include files:
```bash
mkdir ../clj-zenbuild && wget -O - https://api.github.com/repos/plandes/clj-zenbuild/tarball | tar zxfv - -C ../clj-zenbuild --strip-components 1
```
- Compile: `make compile` do compile or `make install` to install in your local
  maven repo.


## Use as a Clojure Library

This software is written in Clojure and can be used in your own Clojure (or
Java) program.  For example, you could create
a [Leiningen plugin](https://nakkaya.com/2010/02/25/writing-leiningen-plugins-101/).

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/filedup/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/filedup/)
